                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Introduction:- </strong><br>Science has changed man’s life
                        from stone age to modern age which is also called age of science. During stone age we find that
                        man was helpless in the cradle of nature. little by little man progressed in the science with
                        new discoveries and inventions. Scientific discoveries and inventions have changed the face of
                        this planet. Life today has become very comfortable and easy. it is science that produced and
                        developed human civilization. Science and human civilization run parallel. Our forefathers lived
                        in a primitive life, and we are now living in the atomic age. Sciences provided comforts to us
                        in almost every walk of life. Science is nothing but a systematic way of knowledge and living.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Inventions of science:- </strong><br>science gives birth to
                        many inventions which provides service reliability and comfort. Almost all things of necessity
                        Comfort or Luxury that we see around us came from a scientific invention one day or the other.
                        The whole medical system, the means of transport—cars, scooters, trucks, trains and all means of
                        communication were invented in the past. Scientific inventions have changed the face of the
                        world.</p>


                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Electricity:- </strong><br> electricity is one of the most
                        greatest invention of science. In today's world most of the things and scientific inventions are
                        run with the help of electricity. Electricity is the greatest gift of science to mankind. We
                        have reached a point of our civilization when electricity is used for all purposes. Without it,
                        our existence will be impossible. Electricity is of vital use in industries and factories,
                        electricity no factory can run. Electricity is a means of communication. Telegraph and telegram
                        device is based on electricity. The most important wonder of electricity is felt in the field of
                        medical science. X-Ray, Scanning, Ultra Sonographer Test, E.C.G., Endoscopy, etc. are the
                        developed devices in the field of medicine and surgery. This is possible due to electricity
                        only.</p>



                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Means of transportation and communication:-
                        </strong><br>science complete Li change the image of transportation and communication
                        facilities. In olden times, when a person sent a message or goods to his/her friend or relative,
                        it took months even years. But today we have traffic resources like airplanes and bullet trains,
                        so that we can go from one end of the world to the other in a few minutes or hours. Today we
                        have telephone like fax, machine, computer, telephone etc. devices through which we can send our
                        message to any person live in whatever place in world in few milliseconds or second. All the
                        things are possible by science.</p>



                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Computer:- </strong><br> A computer is an electronic device
                        which can perform many tasks like messaging, calculations, data storage, printing, etc. It is
                        also one of the greatest invention of science. The computer is an essential part of our life. It
                        is the vital element and part of all field of life including education, health, economy,
                        industry, media etc. In fact, our progress today is entirely dependent on technology, computers
                        powered with Internet.</p>



                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Atomic energy:- </strong><br>atomic energy is the second
                        name of nuclear energy. In comparison to other traditional fossil fuels as energy sources,
                        nuclear power produces enormous amount of energy. No other source of energy can produce such
                        amount of power from a very small quantity of material. Therefore , in future nuclear energy
                        will be become the primary source energy.</p>



                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Medical and surgery:- </strong><br>Science has been an
                        important role in the field of medicine today in the emergency patients get a very good
                        treatment and their lives can be saved. Today it is possible to avoid the biggest disease. From
                        minute to minute fracture can be detected by X-ray machine. With the help of modern surgical
                        instruments transplantation of any part of human body become possible.</p>



                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion:- </strong><br>Science is a great helper of
                        modern technology eat properly used it can make the life easy held there and helper because of
                        science that man is called Master of the world.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Why we needs sports and games :-The </strong><br>The real
                        education is one which we can make a student intellectually sharp, physically strong and morally
                        sound. It develops and strengthens the three aspect of our personality mind, body and the
                        soul.in this sense games and sport are the basic need of our life unless the development of mind
                        and body goes hand in hand with a corresponding awakening of the soul, the former alone would
                        prove to be a poor, lop-sides affair. Therefore,games and sport must form and integral part of
                        the education of our youth.
                        <br> Sofa physical education has been neglected in our educational system. Games and sport have
                        been woefully neglected in our schools and colleges. Our education has been concerned only with
                        earning degrees and diplomas. No wonder then our youngmen have started hating physical labour.
                        Our graduates who come over to out University with gold medals are physically wreks. It darkens
                        their future completely. <br>
                        Hence there is a need to change our attitude towards game and sport. Some people think that
                        sports and games are unimportant things that people do at times when they are not working. They
                        consider them only as amusement like the cinema aur radio, such things,they think are harmful
                        for our studies of students womanist at all times continue to stuff is brain with facts and
                        figures. In fact, however, sports and games are great value, especially to the students who work
                        with their brains most of the day. <br>
                    </p>


                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Benefits of playing games and types of
                            games:-</strong><br>sports and games make our body strong and keep us healthy little brain
                        work can be done by an ailing person. A sound mind resides only in a sound body. Physical
                        exercise is essential for health. Every nerve, every sinew and every joint of the body get
                        strengthened through games. But a good health is not the only thing we get through them. The
                        gives us valuable practice in making eyes, brain and muscles work together. For example, in
                        tennis for instance, our eyes see the ball coming, judge its speed and direction and pass this
                        information on the brain. The brain has then to decide what to do, sent it order to the muscles
                        of the arms, legs and so on so that the ball is met and hit back where it ought to go. All this
                        must happen with,only those who have had a lot of practice it tennis can carry out this
                        complicated chain of events successfully. <br>
                        There are games that require mind and body coordination, and they include games like cricket and
                        baseball. Baseball is mostly played abroad in America and Japan. Cricket is famous in most of
                        the countries that were once under British Colonialism. These include Australia, India, and West
                        Indies. If one does not want to get involved in outdoor games, then indoor games are for them. A
                        move out of the sedentary life is essential. <br>
                        There are several indoor games present. Indoor games include chess, ludo, Chinese checker, and
                        monopoly. There are several card games that can also be played for fun and activity. These card
                        games include hearts, bridge, 29, and several other games of chance. Chess is a game that calls
                        for a tremendous amount of patience. It requires eh complete concentration of the player. So
                        there are several benefits for the mind in the case of Indoor as well as outdoor games. It
                        increases the mindfulness f individuals and reduces stress and anxiety. Several doctors suggest
                        taking up sports activities to those that are suffering from depression and severe stress and
                        anxiety. <br>
                    </p>







                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Some of the major benefits of playing games and sports are
                            given as below</strong><br>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Better Sleep</li>
                        <li>A Strong Heart</li>
                        <li>Improved Lung Function</li>

                    </ul>

                    sports and games are also very useful for character training in their lesson IT college, boys and
                    girls may learn about such virtues as selfishness, discipline and love if ones country. But what is
                    learnt in books can’t have the same dip effect of a person’s character as what is learnt by
                    experiences. Game inculcate in the players the habit of teamwork,discipline is being guided by a
                    captain obedience to the rules of the game as interpreted by the referee or empires and spirit of
                    sportsmanship in taking the defeat along with victory with a smile. If we want a disciplined nation,
                    we must give duo encouragement to games and sport in our schools and colleges. <br>
                    </p>





                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion:- </strong><br>recreational value of sport and
                        games cannot also be denied. After a tiring day in the classroom, in laboratory or at your desk,
                        there is nothing more refreshing than an hour in the field. Hot game of hockey, or a fast match
                        of football and exciting cricket takes off hour fatigue. One feels fresh once again for any
                        amount of work. Therefore games and sport does must be compulsory for all students. Colleges and
                        school should have proper equipments and facilities for the students. The team may win or loss,
                        games play their wonderful role of making a student active and agile in their life.<br>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Introduction:- </strong><br>science and industry have made
                        human life easier, healthier and happier. But these have also brought about the problem of
                        pollution. Today pollution has assumed so gigantic proposals that a very existence of human life
                        is in threat. Pollution has become a very common yet issue in today's world. It has become so
                        common that almost everyone acknowledges the fact that pollution is rising continuously. if
                        pollution continues to increase unchecked that the day is not for when life would become
                        difficult. even beautiful buildings like Taj Mahal are facing the danger of losing their lustre
                        because of the pollution in river Yamuna.Pollution is a global problem. Although urban areas are
                        usually more polluted than the countryside, pollution can spread to remote places where no
                        people live. For example, pesticides and other chemicals have been found in the Antarctic ice
                        sheet. In the middle of the northern Pacific Ocean, a huge collection of microscopic plastic
                        particles forms what is known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.
                    </p>




                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What is pollution?</strong><br>
                        Pollution, also called environmental pollution, the addition of any substance (solid, liquid, or
                        gas) or any form of energy (such as heat, sound, or radioactivity) to the environment at a rate
                        faster than it can be dispersed, diluted, decomposed, recycled, or stored in some harmless form.
                        Pollutions are of many types like air pollution ,soil pollution, water pollution, industrial
                        pollution, nuclear pollution etc
                    </p>


                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Water pollution:-</strong><br>Water pollution is the
                        contamination of water bodies, usually as a result of human activities. Water bodies include for
                        example lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers and groundwater. Water pollution results when
                        contaminants are introduced into the natural environment. For example, releasing inadequately
                        treated wastewater into natural water bodies can lead to degradation of aquatic ecosystems. In
                        turn, this can lead to public health problems for people living downstream. They may use the
                        same polluted river water for drinking or bathing or irrigation. Water pollution is the leading
                        worldwide cause of death and disease, e.g. due to water-borne diseases.</p>



                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Air pollution:-</strong><br>The rising concentration of the
                        corrosive and toxic substances in the fresh air of the environment is generating air pollution.
                        Many types of foreign particles, noxious gases and other pollutants discharged from various
                        human actions are changing the fresh air, which harms living beings like human beings, animals
                        and plants.</p>



                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Soil pollution:- </strong><br>Soil pollution can be defined
                        as persistent of chemicals, salts, toxic compounds, radioactive materials, that have adverse
                        effects on animal health and plant growth. There are many ways through which soils can get
                        polluted like discharge of industrial wastage into earth surface, seepage through landfill,
                        underground storage tanks getting ruptured, solid waste seepage, formation of contaminated water
                        into soil, discharge of heavy metals in petroleum etc.</p>



                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Nuclear pollution:- </strong><br>Any undesirable effect
                        caused to the environment due to radioactive substances or radiations is called nuclear
                        pollution. Major source is the Nuclear power plants. If traces of the radioactive substances are
                        present in the water that is released from the plant, it will cause nuclear pollution. Emission
                        of radiations can also cause this kind of pollution.</p>



                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Effects of pollution:-</strong><br>Pollution affects the
                        quality of life more than one can imagine. It works in mysterious ways, sometimes which cannot
                        be seen by the naked eye. However, it is very much present in the environment. For instance, you
                        might not be able to see the natural gases present in the air, but they are still there.
                        Similarly, the pollutants which are messing up the air and increasing the levels of carbon
                        dioxide is very dangerous for humans. Increased level of carbon dioxide will lead to global
                        warming. <br>

                        Further, the water is polluted in the name of industrial development, religious practices and
                        more will cause a shortage of drinking water. Without water, human life is not possible.
                        Moreover, the way waste is dumped on the land eventually ends up in the soil and turns toxic. If
                        land pollution keeps on happening at this rate, we won’t have fertile soil to grow our crops on.
                        Therefore, serious measures must be taken to reduce pollution to the core.
                    </p>



                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion:- </strong><br>To sum it up, all types of
                        pollution is hazardous and comes with grave consequences. Everyone must take a step towards
                        change ranging from individuals to the industries. As tackling this problem calls for a joint
                        effort, so we must join hands now. Moreover, the innocent lives of animals are being lost
                        because of such human activities. So, all of us must take a stand and become a voice for the
                        unheard in order to make this earth pollution-free.
