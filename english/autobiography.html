                                <p>In 1995, Musk and his brother, Kimbal, started Zip2, a web software company, with
                                    money raised from a small group of angel investors. The company developed and
                                    marketed an Internet "city guide" for the newspaper publishing industry. Musk
                                    obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune and persuaded the
                                    board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with CitySearch. While at Zip2,
                                    Musk wanted to become CEO; however, none of the board members would allow it. Compaq
                                    acquired Zip2 for US$307 million in cash and US$34 million in stock options in
                                    February 1999. Musk received US$22 million for his 7 percent share from the sale.

                        <li><strong>X.com and PayPal (1999)</strong><br>
                            <p>In March 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment
                                company, with US$10 million from the sale of Zip2. One year later, the company merged
                                with Confinity, which had a money transfer service called PayPal. The merged company
                                focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001. PayPal's early growth was
                                driven mainly by a viral marketing campaign where new customers were recruited when they
                                received money through the service. Musk was ousted in October 2000 from his role as CEO
                                (although he remained on the board) due to disagreements with other company leadership,
                                notably over his desire to move PayPal's Unix-based infrastructure to Microsoft Windows.
                                In October 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for US$1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk
                                received US$165 million. Before its sale, Musk, who was the company's largest
                                shareholder, owned 11.7% of PayPal's shares.</p>

                        <li><strong>SpaceX (2001)</strong><br>
                            <p>In 2001, Musk conceptualized "Mars Oasis"; a project to land a miniature experimental
                                greenhouse on Mars, containing food crops growing on Martian regolith, in an attempt to
                                regain public interest in space exploration. In October 2001, Musk travelled to Moscow
                                with Jim Cantrell (an aerospace supplies fixer), and Adeo Ressi (his best friend from
                                college), to buy refurbished Dnepr Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that
                                could send the envisioned payloads into space. The group met with companies such as NPO
                                Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, according to Cantrell, Musk was seen as a novice and
                                was consequently spat on by one of the Russian chief designers, and the group returned
                                to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to
                                look for three ICBMs, bringing along Mike Griffin. Griffin had worked for the CIA's
                                venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel, as well as NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and was just
                                leaving Orbital Sciences, a maker of satellites and spacecraft. The group met again with
                                Kosmotras, and were offered one rocket for US$8 million, however, this was seen by Musk
                                as too expensive; Musk consequently stormed out of the meeting. On the flight back from
                                Moscow, Musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable
                                rockets he needed. According to early Tesla and SpaceX investor Steve Jurvetson, Musk
                                calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket actually were only 3 percent of
                                the sales price of a rocket at the time. It was concluded that theoretically, by
                                applying vertical integration and the modular approach from software engineering, SpaceX
                                could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a 70-percent gross margin.
                                Ultimately, Musk ended up founding SpaceX with the long-term goal of creating a "true
                                spacefaring civilization".</p>

                            <strong>SolarCity (2006)</strong><br>
                            <p>Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which was then
                                co-founded in 2006 by his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive. By 2013, SolarCity was the
                                second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States. SolarCity was
                                acquired by Tesla, Inc. in 2016 and is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of Tesla. The
                                underlying motivation for funding both SolarCity and Tesla was to help combat global
                                warming. In 2012, Musk announced that SolarCity and Tesla are collaborating to use
                                electric vehicle batteries to smooth the impact of rooftop solar on the power grid, with
                                the program going live in 2013. On June 17, 2014, Musk committed to building a SolarCity
                                advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York, that would triple the size of the
                                largest solar plant in the United States. Musk stated the plant will be "one of the
                                single largest solar panel production plants in the world", and it will be followed by
                                one or more even bigger facilities in subsequent years</p>

                            <strong>Tesla (2013)</strong><br>
                            <p>Tesla, Inc. (originally Tesla Motors) was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard
                                and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding. <br>

                                Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Elon Musk's
                                involvement. Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004, joining Tesla's
                                board of directors as its chairman. Musk took an active role within the company and
                                oversaw Roadster product design at a detailed level, but was not deeply involved in
                                day-to-day business operations. Following the financial crisis in 2008,Musk assumed
                                leadership of the company as CEO and product architect, positions he still holds today.
                                Tesla Motors first built an electric sports car, the Tesla Roadster in 2008, with sales
                                of about 2,500 vehicles to 31 countries. Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S
                                sedan on June 22, 2012. It unveiled its third product, the Model X, aimed at the
                                SUV/minivan market, on February 9, 2012; however, the Model X launch was delayed until
                                September 2015. In addition to its own cars, Tesla sells electric powertrain systems to
                                Daimler for the Smart EV, Mercedes B-Class Electric Drive and Mercedes A Class, and to
                                Toyota for the RAV4 EV. Musk was able to bring in both companies as long-term investors
                                in Tesla.</p>

                            <strong>Hyperloop (2013)</strong><br>
                            <p>On August 12, 2013, Musk unveiled a concept for a high-speed transportation system
                                incorporating reduced-pressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air
                                cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors. The mechanism for
                                releasing the concept was an alpha-design document that, in addition to scoping out the
                                technology, outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built:
                                between the Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area. After earlier
                                envisioning Hyperloop, Musk assigned a dozen engineers from Tesla and SpaceX who worked
                                for nine months, establishing the conceptual foundations and creating the designs for
                                the transportation system. An early design for the system was then published in a
                                whitepaper posted to the Tesla and SpaceX blogs. Musk's proposal, if technologically
                                feasible at the costs he has cited, would make Hyperloop travel cheaper than any other
                                mode of transport for such long distances. The alpha design was proposed to use a
                                partial vacuum to reduce aerodynamic drag, which it is theorized would allow for
                                high-speed travel with relatively low power, with certain other features like
                                air-bearing skis and an inlet compressor to reduce freestream flow. The document of
                                alpha design estimated the total cost of an LA-to-SF Hyperloop system at US$6 billion,
                                but this amount is speculative. In June 2015, Musk announced a design competition for
                                students and others to build Hyperloop pods to operate on a SpaceX-sponsored mile-long
                                track in a 2015–2017 Hyperloop pod competition. The track was used in January 2017, and
                                Musk also started building a tunnel. Hyperloop One, a company unaffiliated with Musk,
                                had announced that it had done its first successful test run on its DevLoop track in
                                Nevada on July 13, 2017. It was on May 12, 2017 at 12:02 a.m. and had lasted 5.3
                                seconds, reaching a top speed of 70 mph. On July 20, 2017, Elon Musk announced that he
                                had gotten "verbal government approval" to build a hyperloop from New York City to
                                Washington D.C, stopping in both Philadelphia and Baltimore. However, the New York City
                                Transit Authority, Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, Washington
                                Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, Maryland Transit Administration, United States
                                Department of Homeland Security, as well as the mayors of New York, Philadelphia,
                                Baltimore, and Washington D.C. stated that they are unaware of any such agreement.</p>

                            <p>In December 2015, Musk announced the creation of OpenAI, a not-for-profit artificial
                                intelligence (AI) research company. OpenAI aims to develop artificial general
                                intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity. By making AI available to
                                everyone, OpenAI wants to "counteract large corporations who may gain too much power by
                                owning super-intelligence systems devoted to profits, as well as governments which may
                                use AI to gain power and even oppress their citizenry". Musk has stated he wants to
                                counteract the concentration of power.</p>

                            <p>In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company, to integrate the
                                human brain with artificial intelligence. The company, which is still in the earliest
                                stages of existence, is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human
                                brain, with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep
                                pace with advancements in artificial intelligence. These enhancements could improve
                                memory or allow for more direct interfacing with computing devices. Musk sees Neuralink
                                and OpenAI as related: "OpenAI is a nonprofit dedicated to minimizing the dangers of
                                artificial intelligence, while Neuralink is working on ways to implant technology into
                                our brains to create mind-computer interfaces. ... Neuralink allows our brains to keep
                                up in the intelligence race. The machines can't outsmart us if we have everything the
                                machines have plus everything we have. At least, that is if you assume that what we have
                                is actually an advantage."</p>

                            <strong>The Boring Company (2016)</strong><br />
                            <p>On December 17, 2016, while stuck in traffic, Musk tweeted "Am going to build a tunnel
                                boring machine and just start digging..." The company was named 'The Boring Company'. On
                                January 21, 2017, Musk tweeted "Exciting progress on the tunnel front. Plan to start
                                digging in a month or so." The first tunnel will start on the SpaceX campus,and will
                                probably go to a nearby parking garage. As of January 26, 2017, discussions with
                                regulatory bodies have begun, but no requests for permits to dig in the Los Angeles area
                                had been filed with the California Department of Transportation by late January 2017. In
                                February 2017, the company began digging a 30-foot-wide, 50-foot-long, and 15-foot-deep
                                "test trench" on the premises of Space X's offices in Los Angeles, since the
                                construction requires no permits. Musk has said that a 10-fold decrease in tunnel boring
                                cost per mile is necessary for economic feasibility of the proposed tunnel network.</p>
